                <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                <p>My name is Bobby Saba and I am a PhD student at the University of Oklahoma. Like many others in the field, I have had a passion for the weather from a young age. Yet unlike many in the field, my interest doesn't stem from a particular event; it comes from tv. I still vividly remember watching 'Storm Chasers' on the television in early elementary school and from that day on, I knew the weather was for me. While my 7 year old self thought chasing storms was the perfect career path, my parents heavily suggested otherwise. I then pivoted very quickly after discovering the role of broadcast meteorologists and it was smooth sailing from there.</p>
                
                <p>Growing up in Mansfield, MA, I knew that staying in New England was a must for my undergraduate studies. I found myself trekking up to the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont to what was Northern Vermont University (NVU) - Lyndon to start what went on to become my fondest years. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I strived to take advantage of any and all opportunities to explore the field and give back to the community. That included trying out research during the summer of 2020 when COVID-19 hindered any opportunity of getting an internship at a news station! At the time, I wasn't thrilled. Yet over that summer I learned that I didn't need to go into broadcasting to help the community and that research was...well...more enjoyable than I expected!</p>

                <h3>Research Journey</h3>
                <p>As a definitive extrovert, I was constantly fearful of research. In my mind, I had no desire to sit behind a computer and code all day (ironic that I now consider coding this website 'fun'). When I took my first research internship in summer 2020, I was skeptical...or whatever more than skeptical is. Over the course of 10 weeks, I learned quite a bit! First, research and particularly, programming, were actually quite enjoyable. Second, I wasn't great at research or programming. Third, lightning research was likely not my thing. Even with all of these lessons learned, I was still confident that broadcasting was where I wanted to be. Little did I know that the summer of 2021 would change my entire philosophy when it came to research while altering what had been my career aspirations for well over a decade.</p>

                <p>As a recipient of NOAA's Hollings Scholarship, I was lucky enough to intern with the Storm Prediction Center (albeit remotely) for 10 weeks. Although it was evident, especially in my programming ability, that I was still new to research, I cannot say enough kind things about my mentors from that summer who complete reshaped my thought process when it came to the research process. Whether it be the excitement of creating new results, or working with collaborators on direct applications towards public safety, this experience convinced me that graduate school was for me. It was because of that internship that I was able to make connections and learn about the research taking place at OU and in Norman. One year later, I was driving across the country to begin my next chapter as a graduate student conducting severe storms research.</p>

                <h3>Community Involvement</h3>
                <p>From volunteering at my hometown charity to leading student organizations at NVU and now OU, being active in the community is as important to me as my formal career. As president of the NVU-Lyndon chapter of the AMS/NWA, I aimed to leave a lasting impact on both the club and the events they hosted for their members and the weather community nationwide. This included increasing university funding by over 2,000% to increase opportunities for members to attend both regional and annual conferences. In addition, I planned and chaired the annual Northeastern Storm Conference; the largest and longest-running student-led conference of its kind in the nation. These were some of my most rewarding years and the chapter had the privilege of receiving the Student Chapter of the Year award from national AMS during both years I served in the role.</p>

                <p>Although the opportunities have changed since graduation in 2022, I have continued to give back to the meteorological community in any way possible. This has included involvement as the Masters Representative, Graduate Vice-Chair, and Chairperson of OU School of Meteorology's Student Affairs Committee (SAC). Through SAC, I co-led a nationwide stipend review of all graduate school assistantships to ensure both OU graduate students and students at other universities across the country were receiving fair pay in the ever-changing economy. This has lead to a 12% raise for the School of Meteorology graduate students and up to 25% raises for other programs across the country. Nationally, I am currently a co-chair in training for the AMS Student Conference Planning Committee, a member of the Local Chapter Affairs Committee, and a student member on the Severe Local Storms STAC committee!</p>

                <h3>Beyond the Weather</h3>
                <p>If I'm not behind a computer or out in the field you can find me doing just about anything with friends or family. Whether it's trying a new restaurant in town, playing some pickleball, or just hanging out, I'm constantly testing the limits of my social battery. All I ask is that you don't get me started on the downfall of the New England Patriots dynasty or the Jason Tatum achilles injury because I'll definitely have some choice words to say. Suffice to say, I find a way to always have Boston sports on the TV and I love to talk sports with anyone, especially if they cn help me with my fantasy football roster!</p>

                <h3>What the Future Holds</h3>
                <p>Ordinarily, predicting the future is difficult. But when you've spent over seven years learning the ins and outs of our atmosphere.....it's still difficult. While I have thoroughly enjoyed my time conducting research, teaching courses, participating in field work, and doing everything else since I started in the field in 2018, I frequently have a hard time narrowing down whats next after my time in Norman. I'm very open to pursuing a faculty role at a teaching centric university, continuing to conduct research in severe storms and tornado dynamics, and everything in between. Feel free to <a href="{{ '/contact/' | relative_url }}">contact me</a> if there are opportunities you think might be a good fit or if you're looking to talk research/collaboration!</p>
